# Wordpress jQuery & plugins Async Loader
Loading of JavaScript resources should be done asynchronously, in a non-blocking manner, so the load time of your webpage will not be affected. But using of deferring or async loading of jQuery causes lots of problems with jQuery plugins. This plugin replaces default Wordpress's JS loader with a special jQuery loader (jQl), that's why there are no any errors with jQuery plugins.
